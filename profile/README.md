[KCL](https://github.com/kcl-lang/kcl) is a constraint-based record & functional language mainly used in cloud-native configuration and policy scenarios. It is hosted by the **Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) as a Sandbox Project**.

## What is it for?

KCL aims to provide the following capabilities:

+ Hide infrastructure and platform details by defining more appropriate **API abstractions** to reduce the burden of developers.
+ **Mutate** and **validate** existing config files or manifests through numerous community modules.
+ **Manage large-scale configuration data** across teams without side effects through configuration and policy language for GitOps.

Specifically, KCL can

+ Improve the ability to **semantically validate configurations** at the code level, such as schema definitions, required/optional attribute requirements, types, range constraints, and etc.
+ Provide capabilities for **writing, combining, and abstracting configuration chunks**, such as structure definitions, structure inheritance, constraint definitions, and configuration policy merging.
+ Enhance configuration flexibility by adopting **modern programming language** features, such as conditional statements, loops, functions, and package management, to improve configuration reusability.
+ Provide **comprehensive toolchain support**, including rich IDE extensions and toolchains support to reduce the learning curve and enhance the user experience.
+ Enable easier sharing, propagation, and delivery of configurations between different teams/roles through **package management tools** and **OCI registries**.
+ Offer a **high-performance** compiler to meet the demands of scalable configuration scenarios, such as rendering performance for generating configurations for different environments and topologies based on a baseline configuration and configuration automation modification performance requirements.
+ Improve **automation integration** capabilities through **multi-language SDKs**, **KCL language plugins**, and other means, significantly reducing the learning curve while leveraging the value of configuration and policy writing with KCL.
+ Used as a **platform engineering language** to deliver modern apps with [KusionStack](https://github.com/KusionStack).
